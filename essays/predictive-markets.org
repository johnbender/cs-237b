* problem
  premature refactoring can be wasterful
  deciding when to refactor and how often requires a crystal ball
  but! it is often the case that experience can provide an approximation of such a crystal ball

* idea
  use the wisdom of the crowd, motivated by money, to 'divine' where changes will occur
  and therefore where the most design time should be spent to minimize impact during those changes
