* ideas for reduction
  - refactor duplicate assumptions
  - refactor assumptions that weaken the argument
  - simplify proofs
  - group/hide based on programmer direction
  - mutation testing to reduce assumptions: http://pitest.org/

* notable
  - category list global assumption is only needed for proofs in the "with a category" context
  - first test in second proof requires initial assumptions
  - output creates virtuous cycle
  - duplicate assumptions, from the first proof:
    - a fabricated category `cat` exists
    - a fabricated topic exists with the category `cat`
    - `cat` was sent `set_permissions` with `:admins => :full`
    - `cat` was sent `save`
    and from the second proof (rename `private_cat` to `cat`):
    - a fabricated category `private_cat` exists
    - a fabricated topic exists with the category `private_cat`
    - `private_cat` was sent `set_permission` with `:admins => :full`
    - `private_cat` was sent `save`

* CategoryList
  under the assumptions:
  - a fabricated user exists
  - a fabricated admin exists
  - a new category list created with a new guardian created with a new user exists

** in the context of "security"
   under the proof specific assumptions:
   - a fabricated category `cat` exists
   - a fabricated topic exists with the category `cat`
   - `cat` was sent `set_permissions` with `:admins => :full`
   - `cat` was sent `save`

   it can be shown that:
   - a new CategoryList created with a new Guardian created with the fabricated admin
     sent categories sent count will have a value equal to 2
   - a new CategoryList created with a new Guardian created with the fabricated user
     sent categories sent count will have a value equal to 2
   - a new CategoryList created with a new Guardian created with nothing
     sent categories sent count will have a value equal to 2

   intuitively, CategoryList can properly hide secure categories

   further

   under the proof specific assumptions:
   - a fabricated category `public_cat` exists
   - a fabricated topic exists with the category `public_cat`
   - a fabricated category `private_cat` exists
   - a fabricated topic exists with the category `private_cat`
   - `private_cat` was sent `set_permission` with `:admins => :full`
   - `private_cat` was sent `save`
   - a fabricated category `secret_subcat` exists with `:parent_category_id => public_cat.id`
   - a fabricated topic exists with the category `secret_subcat`
   - `secret_subcat` was sent `set_permissions` with `admins => :full`
   - CategoryFeaturedTopic is sent `feature_topics`

   it can be shown that:
   - a new CategoryList created with a new Guardian created with the fabricated admin
     sent `categories` sent `find` with block { |x| x.name == public_cat.name }
     sent `displayable_topics` sent `count` will have a value equal to two
   - ...

   intuitively, CategoryList doesn't show topics that you can't view
